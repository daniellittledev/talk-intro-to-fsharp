how many things are wrong with this design

type Contact = {
    FirstName: string
    MiddleName: string
    ListName: string
    
    EmailAddress: string
    IsEmailVerified: bool
}

Domain modelling made functional


- Functional programming is scary
 - Functor
 - Currying
 - Catamorphism
 - Applicative
 - Monad
 - Monoid

- Unfamiliar
 - Mappable
 - Collapsable
 - Chainable
 - Aggregatable

- Object originated programmis is scary
 - Generics
 - Polymorphism
 - Interface
 - Inheritence
 - SOLID
 - Covariance
 
You don't think it scary because you are familar


Part 1: The importance of Design
Part 2: Understanding FP Type Systems
- Compositon

Payment types example (pretty good) 20min in

Part 3: Domain Modelling with composable types
- Optional values
 (Types as Sets)
 
 
Gets back to original example
